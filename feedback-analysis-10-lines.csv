I don't like the three K-cups that are available right now for hot chocolate above about Ok. But this packet version from Ghirardelli is some of the best Hot Chocolate I've ever had. Really a rich chocolate taste.,5,positivo
"I purchased Natural Vitality's <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WVY4PE"">Natural Calm Raspberry-Lemon 16 oz</a> as a magnesium supplement to help me absorb calcium better because I was diagnosed with osteopenia--precursor to osteoporosis.  I will have to wait until my next bone density test in about a year and a half to find out if adding this readily absorbed magnesium product has helped my bones.  In the mean time, however, it has helped with my chronic constipation.  I had been using stool softeners for the past couple of years and this works much better.  It is a powder which you mix in a cup of hot water and stir.  I usually take 5 grams (a heaping teaspoon) once a day.  After it is dissolved, I add a little cold water so I can drink it quickly, although it does taste good.",5,positivo
"I have to say that the Stinger Waffles are the best energy snack to come on the market in years.  I love these things.  I cycle, and the fact that these are flat make them really easy to carry in a jersey pocket.  They don't have huge amounts of calories, but they definitely help me keep going during a long workout.  And they taste so good, that I keep them around as regular snacks, even when I am not exercising.<br /><br />The only downside to these (and the reasons they get 4 stars): the packages aren't the easiest to open.  I usually only open them when stopped if it is during a ride.  If I could give half-stars, these would be 4.5!",4,positivo
"This popcorn is definitely really tasty.  I am knocking off ONE star for the relatively small quantity in the bag (open it and it appears almost halfway empty, which is probably a good thing because it's delicious and I tend to eat the whole bag in a couple hours).  I agree that it seems heavier on the caramel corn, and I'd prefer a bit more cheddar corn.  Overall a delicious product though.  Tastes very fresh, and few hulls.",4,positivo
"This is crazy hot. I thought I was decent with hot food, but this stuff had me drinking a half gallon of milk in under 20 minutes. When you try it, avoid getting it in the back of your throat. If you do anyway, don't talk or laugh. haha It makes it hurt more. Fun to try though and it has a great taste. I recommend it to anyone that loves hot sauce and people that want to try it for fun. The amount I tried was probably about half the size of those taco bell packets(hopefully most people understand that amount) for one taco.",5,positivo
"With the subscribe and save option, this stuff is a great bargain.  It really has a nice, strong flavor but does not overwhelm, and while it's said that you don't need to cook with top-grade oil, I am suspicious of the European oils that are packed and shipped from Italy, Spain, or Greece containing oils from who knows where.  Learned of it from a top chef - it's the oil he uses in his fine dining kitchen.",5,positivo
This is a great product that seems to be getting harder to find.  I recommend letting the tea bag sit in the liquor longer than the directions suggest. These teas would be a fun thing for a bridal shower or any ladies get-together. Cheers!,5,positivo
"The most delicious coffee in a long time.  It is sweet so you don't need to add any sweetener (unless you are a sweet freak).  And, since I am a diabetic, I had concerns but it doesn't seem to bump my sugar readings up.  Very good product.  And a great price at Amazon.",5,positivo
"These are definitely my go-to snack and I must admit, I'm kinda addicted to them.  I tried other Cheez-Its when my store stopped carrying these and nothing compared, thank goodness for Amazon!  Great price and I love the flavor and texture of these particular ones.  I just wish they were a tad healthier and actually had more whole grain and fiber.",5,positivo
MY 11 YR OLD COTON DE TULEAR LOVES THIS FLAVOR.  OF COURSE I ADD A BIT OF BOILED CHICKEN ONCE IN AWHILE FOR A SPECIAL TREAT,5,positivo
